      What is FreshSense?
      <div class="dropdown">
        <p class="small-text">
          FreshSense is a simple, easy-to-use system that “smells” the air inside 
          mushroom farms. Imagine a small device, about the size of your hand, quietly 
          working in the corner of a grow room. It reads the air every second, looking for 
          unusual odors that may signal problems such as mold, bad bacteria, or issues 
          with the growing material.
        </p>
        <p class="small-text">
          Once FreshSense detects something unusual, it sends a quick alert to the 
          farmer’s phone. This means the farmer can take action right away—long before 
          the problem becomes visible.
        </p>
        <p class="small-text">
          FreshSense acts like a “nose that never sleeps,” helping farmers protect their 
          harvest 24 hours a day.

      Why Smell Matters
      <div class="dropdown">
        <p class="small-text">
          Most mushroom problems start quietly. Before mold becomes green, or before 
          bacteria spreads, they release tiny smells that humans cannot notice. These 
          smells show up hours or even days before any visible signs appear.
        </p>
      
        <p class="small-text">
          Farmers usually discover problems when it’s too late—when mushrooms look 
          sick, when the trays turn strange colors, or when the room begins to smell odd. 
          At this point, the contamination has already spread
        </p>
        
        <p class="small-text">
          FreshSense solves this by detecting early smells that are invisible and 
          impossible to notice without technology. It gives farmers a “head start,” 
          allowing them to stop problems early and save most—or even all—of the 
          harvest.

          A Smart Odor Sensor
        </p>
       
        <p class="small-text">
          This is the small device placed in mushroom growing rooms. It checks the air 
          for certain smells that are known to be early signs of trouble. It doesn’t need 
          water, sunlight, or complicated setup—just place it and turn it on
        </p>

        <p class="big-text">
          A Mobile App for Farmers
        </p>
       
        <p class="small-text">
          The app shows what FreshSense is detecting. If the air is clean and healthy, 
          everything will appear green. If something unusual starts to happen, the app 
          changes color and sends a message like:
        </p>

        <p class="small-bullet-text">
          • “Warning: Possible mold activity in Room 2.”
        </p>

        <p class="small-bullet-text">
          • “Alert: Air quality changing—check humidity or ventilation.
        </p>

        <p class="small-text">
          Farmers can then act quickly by adjusting temperature, cleaning a tray, 
          improving airflow, or removing infected spots.
        </p>

        <p class="small-text">
          Everything is designed to be easy to understand so any farmer, no matter 
          their background, can use it comfortably.
        </p>
